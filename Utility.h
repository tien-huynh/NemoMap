			The selected node would be used to start the next mapping round to the target network, since the
			constraints help to reduce possible branching out of the recursive mapping function, thus improve runtime performance
			The selection process involves three ranking levels (if there is no tie with the 1st ranked node, we break and choose that 1st node):
				(1) Rank neighbor nodes with most already-mapped neighbors
				(2) Rank neighbor nodes with highest out degree
				(3) Rank neighbor nodes with largest neighbor degree sequence
			At any level if there is a tie between the top ranked nodes, we move to the next level to find the best node. If there's
			still a tie after level 3, we arbitraliry choose 1 node from the tie group
